/*
* THEORY AND EXAMPLES
* 1. todo: Study the OOP design patterns, name and explain any three (e.g. Singleton, Factory, Proxy, Pub-Sub)
* Design patterns here for example: https://medium.com/better-programming/javascript-design-patterns-25f0faaaa15
* Pub-Sub was mentioned by Loren and is quite used in JS (https://medium.com/easyread/difference-between-pub-sub-pattern-and-observable-pattern-d5ae3d81e6ce)
*
* 2. todo: Study S.O.L.I.D principles
* Good examples here: https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles
*
* 3. todo: Study OOP concepts (What is Object, What is a class, Constructor, Interfaces ...)
* For examples here in Java: https://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/oops-concepts/
*
* 4. todo: Study OOP features (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
*

/*
* PRACTICE
* 1. todo: Create a tiny Sims game
* Inspired by example we discussed before here under encapsulation section: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/
* In this example you should practice encapsulation
*
* 2. todo: Implement class hierarchy for the school. We need to manage public and private teachers together with students.
* In this scenario you should practice inheritance mainly
* Inspired by example we discussed before here under inheritance section: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/
